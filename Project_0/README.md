### Project discription   
Guess a number guessed by AI with a minimum number of attempts(less then 20).

### What case do we solve?    
It needs to make a programm, which are guessing a number with a minimum number of attempts.

**Conditions:**  
- AI guesses a number from 1 to 100, and our programm has to guess it. 
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is more or less than what we need. 

**Quality metric **     
Results are measured by the average number of attempts at 1000 repetitions. It should be less then 20 on average.

**What we practice**     
We learn how to write a good code on python
